## Overview

Welcome to the **Object Detection** repository! This project demonstrates real-time object detection using two powerful and widely-used algorithms:

1. **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)**: A state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system known for its speed and accuracy.
2. **Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks)**: A robust and accurate object detection model that excels in precision but may be slower compared to YOLO.

Both implementations capture live video from your webcam, perform object detection, and display the results in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detect objects in live camera feeds with minimal latency.
- **Dual Implementations**: Choose between YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN based on your performance and accuracy needs.
- **Easy Setup**: Comprehensive instructions to get you up and running quickly.
- **Customizable**: Modify detection parameters, models, and output settings to suit your requirements.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
